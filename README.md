# mazewebsite
Website version of Christopher Manson's 1985 book, Maze: Solve the World's Most Challenging Puzzle

The website is at [https://inventwithpython.com/mazewebsite/](https://inventwithpython.com/mazewebsite/)

If you want to download a copy of the maze website to play offline on your computer, click the green Code button on this GitHub page and then click Download ZIP. Unpack the zip file on your computer (you only need the mazewebsite folder, you can delete the src folder, .gitignore, and README.md) and then open the mazewebsite/index.html file.

The src/generate_mazewebsite_html.py generates room1.html through room45.html but not the HTML files for index, contest, directions, and prologue. All of these files are already generated and in the mazewebsite folder; you'd only need to run generate_mazewebsite_html.py if you want to make a change to the room*.html files.
