<h1>MAZE $10,000-Prize</h1>

<p><b>Official Contest Rules</b></p>
<p>There are forty-five rooms in the Maze and each room is numbered. As outlined in the directions, by selecting the correct door in each room, it is possible to go from room #1 to room #45 and back to room #1 in only sixteen steps.</p>

<p>TO ENTER THE CONTEST, just print your name, address, and zip code on a plain piece of paper and answer the following three questions:</p>
<p>1. Which sixteen rooms comprise the shortest path from room #1 to room #45 and back to room#1? Room numbers must be given in the order in which you enter the rooms. (Entering room #1 at the start is not considered to be the first step.) For separation, each room must be preceded by the symbol "#."</p>
<p>2. What is the riddle found in room #45, stated exactly as indicated by the clues in the book?</p>
<p>3. What is the answer to the riddle, stated exactly as indicated by the clues in the book?</p>
